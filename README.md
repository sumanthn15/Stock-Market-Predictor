Stock Market Predictor App
This repository contains the code for a Stock Market Predictor App built using Streamlit, with a machine learning model trained on historical stock data using yfinance. The app is deployed on Render.

Features
Real-Time Stock Price Prediction: The app allows users to input a stock ticker and predicts future prices based on historical data.
Interactive Visualizations: Visualize stock trends and prediction results using interactive graphs.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for an easy-to-use web interface.
App Preview
You can try the app live here: Stock Market Predictor on Render

Installation
To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-market-predictor.git
cd stock-market-predictor
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
The app will be available at http://localhost:8501.

Requirements
The project requires the following Python libraries, which are specified in the requirements.txt file:

plaintext
Copy code
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
yfinance
keras
streamlit
To install them, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Model Creation
The machine learning model for predicting stock prices was developed in the Jupyter notebook Stock_Market_Prediction_Model_Creation.ipynb. The model uses a neural network built with Keras and trained on historical stock data from yfinance.

Project Structure
app.py: The main Streamlit app file that contains the logic for the frontend and calls the trained model.
Stock_Market_Prediction_Model_Creation.ipynb: Jupyter notebook used to train the stock market prediction model.
requirements.txt: A list of dependencies required to run the app.
How It Works
The app uses yfinance to fetch historical data for the specified stock ticker.
The trained model (created using Keras) predicts future stock prices based on historical data.
Results are visualized and displayed interactively in the web interface.
Deployment
The app has been deployed on Render. To deploy the app yourself, follow these steps:

Create a Render account and set up a new Web Service.
Connect your GitHub repository to Render.
Render will automatically build and deploy your Streamlit app.
